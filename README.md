# Used_Car_Price_Prediction_Regression_Project
Problem Definition

There is a huge demand for used cars in the Indian Market today. Cars4U is a budding tech start-up that aims to find footholes in the business trend of selling pre-owned cars in the market.
The data is based on the sales of used cars and their various attributes, manufactured in the past 20 years. The Dataset link https://www.kaggle.com/code/nishantrajadhyaksha/cars4u-dataset/input 

Objective

In this case, the target variable is the price of the used cars, and the model will analyze the attributes of the cars (such as age, mileage, brand, model, etc.) to make predictions about their prices.
By leveraging machine learning algorithms and techniques, the project aims to build a regression model that can learn the patterns and relationships between the car attributes and their corresponding prices. This model can then be used to estimate the prices of new, unseen used cars based on their features.
The objective of this regression project is to provide Cars4U with a reliable and accurate pricing model that can help them determine competitive and fair prices for the pre-owned cars they sell. This information can assist both the company and potential buyers in making informed decisions about pricing and purchasing used cars in the Indian market.
